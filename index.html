Well, le action number one is to make a character--don't worry too much about details or all that joy, just something you can work with and others can build off of. (A little backstory, personality, name, blah blah blah.)<br/>
le action number two: SCENE SETTING!!! WORLD BUILDING! GO WILD!!! 8D<br/>
l'action nombre trois: Write a post involving your own character and the world that you have built around him/her if you are the first poster, or if you are the second or more, build off of that world and the "defined barriers" (like, no magic but tons of snow) stated in the first or other post. CHARACTER INTERACTION IS GOOD! CHARACTER INTERACTION IS MY FAVORITE!</blockquote>
<br/>
If you want to work on your character, world, or story building skills, you are in the right place! I've often found that RolePlay with other people's characters and worlds helps develop my own characters and worlds. If you have a story or character (or world) and you want to, jump right in!<br/>
This is not like the other role-plays, which are semi-lit rps. Here, you can make posts of any length or depth (although longer and deeper ones are appreciated. <img alt="cheesy grin" class="smilie smilie_4" src="https://amblesideonline.org/forum/images/smilies/biggrin.gif" title="cheesy grin"/><br/>

OK, I'm placing a character (who desperately needs some definition) in a space-y cafe area. Please (I beg of you) feel free to change the scene, setting and/or story!<br/>

John slid into the metal seat at the bar, following the direction of his silver-haired friend.<br/>
<br/>
"All right, so what do we know?"<br/>
<br/>
"That I deserve to be shot on the spot?" He replied quietly. His eyes, which were normally bright and inquisitive, were dull and had dark bags under them. Gen blinked at his morose visage and her eyebrows lowered into a frown.<br/>
<br/>
"So, you messed up. No big, yeah?<br/>
<br/>
He shook his head and buried it in his arms on the bar table. Gen was quiet. He could almost <span style="font-style: italic;">feel</span> her staring at him, could just imagine the look of pure disbelief that he was probably being given at that very moment. His heart gave a little flutter of amusement, then died, letting him sink once again into his misery. It was his fault that those colonists had died, his fault that the Negatives had converted everyone at Base Six--His fault that Gen had never had a normal life.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Dry up, misery guts!</span> Gen thought at him, but he blatantly ignored her. He felt miserable and gosh darn it, he was going to <span style="font-style: italic;">stay</span> miserable. He heard a clinking and a rustling, then a woman's voice saying:<br/>
<br/>
"Drinks?"<br/>
<br/>
Gen glanced at her friend, smirked, and turned back to the barmaid. "Two vodkas, thanks."<br/>
<br/>
John's head shot up as the barmaid walked away. "I am <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> drinking that!" He cried indignantly, guilt forgotten for the moment. A wicked grin curled across Gen's face.<br/>
<br/>
"Of course you're not."<br/>
<br/>
"And neither are you." He added darkly, glaring at her.<br/>
<br/>
"No indeed. The very thought!"<br/>
<br/>
"Then why--?"<br/>
<br/>
"Shhhh, you'll see!" </p>

<br/>
"Hiya guys," The short-haired, fair-skinned Max Tournelli strolled up to the bar and sat next to the puddle of misery which was John.<br/>
<br/>
"What'cha talking about?" He asked, brown eyes halfheartedly looking at the holographic menu hung over the chillers for something out of the ordinary.<br/>
He glanced down his weakly-tanned arm at the silver watch latched onto his wrist, noting the time, and then back at the door for a moment.<br/>

<br/>
Suddenly the door opens and a young woman walks in, with a dark complexion, a rosy face and a smile. She slowly but deliberately walks to the table and sits next to Gen. <br/>
<br/>
The three seated at the table look up as she walks in, a slight feel of completion filling the countenances of Gen and Max. <br/>
<br/>
Gen greets the new arrival in a slightly hushed tone, "Cynthia! I'm glad you could make it! No trouble on the way?" <br/>
<br/>
Cynthia replies, "No Gen, none at all, though I thought there would be. Have you told him yet?" She said, indicating John.<br/>
<br/>
"Just about to," Gen replied, and John turns to her expectantly. <br/>
<br/>

She reached a hand over John, knocking his glasses from his face and onto the floor. "This bundle of laughs was just telling me how everything is his fault."<br/>
<br/>
"Not <span style="font-style: italic;">everything!</span>" John glared at Gen, and stooped to pick up his glasses.<br/>
<br/>
"He's usually much more fun to be around--not as fun as a taxi-cab full of booze and babes, but... I make do."<br/>
<br/>
A chill entered the room as the door swung open, and a tall girl walked in. A mischievous grin spread across Gen's face as the girl came and seated herself next to her.<br/>
<br/>
"Cynthia! I'm glad you could make it! No trouble on the way?"<br/>
<br/>
"No Gen, none at all, though I thought there would be. Have you told him yet?"<br/>
<br/>
Gen glanced at her friend, who was eyeing her with an expectant, and slightly distrustful, look. At least he wasn't wallowing in self hatred anymore.<br/>
<br/>
"Just about to," she said, then paused, "although, I was rather hoping that you would do the honors."<br/>
<br/>
"Tell me what?" John's eyebrows went up as he raised a steaming mug of tea to his lips, eying the three of them suspiciously. </p>

The group at the bar, too absorbed in their conversation, didn't see the figure across the room suddenly stand bolt upright and bolt under a nearby table. They couldn't hear the thoughts coursing through its brain.<br/>
<br/>
"No! It can't be! I never expected this!" The figure peered under a chair at the latest entry. Then a smile slid up its pale, thin face, and the green eyes sparkled expectantly. "At last the chance of my life!" The figure turned away from the table and crept, ever so slowly, toward the door, blending perfectly with the shadows--a habit acquired through constant practice. An image rose up in its mind: A tall man in a red coat standing up and saying "Well? What do you have to tell me this time?" and she would say, "I have the location of the wanted rebels. Hurry up, before they escape again!"<br/>
<br/>
While dreaming this happy dream, the girl was perhaps not quite so careful as she usually was. She had unknowingly crawled under a table. Now she straightened up suddenly, without knowing a table was right above her. There was a crack and a cry of "Ouch!" </p>

Cynthia stared flatly at Gen, who's green eyes narrowed then rolled. "Oh, fine, if you insist." She sighed, grabbing the two glasses of vodka and pouring them carefully into two small plastic bags, filled with broken glass and a fine, blue powder.<br/>

"I've just about given up on the two of you." John sighed, a half smile flickering across his face for a moment. "Are you in on this?" he asked of Max, who merely smirked, making the pilot toss his hands up in despair. "I give up! I'm going to get another tea."<br/>
<br/>
"No, wait a moment!" Gen said quickly, grabbing the back of his coat and bringing him to a halt with a harsh choking noise. As he spun back into his seat, he thought he saw something moving under a nearby table, but when he looked again, it was gone.<br/>
<br/>
"All right, here it is--you ready?"<br/>
<br/>
"Quite," he said hoarsely, rubbing his neck and turning his head sideways.<br/>
<br/>
"You're going to love it!" Cynthia added, leaning forward and grinning from ear to ear.<br/>
<br/>
"What?!"<br/>
<br/>
"We got a ship." Gen whispered, casting her gaze around the bar as if someone was watching. And even as she did so, John got a haunting, prickling feeling up his spine.<br/>
<br/>
"A ship?" his eyes brightened immediately and he pushed his glasses up his nose, leaning forward. "What kind? What does it look like?"<br/>
<br/>
"Beautiful! I just brought her in," Cynthia replied. "Once we're in, we can get away from here. To somewhere... safer."<br/>
<br/>
"Somewhere less conspicuous," Max added.<br/>
<br/>
"No arguments here," John replied vehemently, draining the last of his tea. "I--"<br/>
<br/>
There was a crash and a table nearby the door toppled over, the people around it leaping up screaming and sending drinks cascading all over the floor. A girl with bright green eyes and a thin face was standing in the middle of the mess, looking dazed, like a deer caught in the headlights of a car.<br/>
<br/>
John leaped to his feet, his pale face draining of all its color. His long-fingered hands began to shake, and the empty mug that he was holding dropped from his grasp and shattered into a million pieces on the floor.<br/>
<br/>
"Its them!" Gen cried, grabbing her coat, "Run!" She grabbed John by his collar and flung him after toward the door, then grabbed the two vodka bags and threw them at the dazed girl. As they reached the peak of their arc she raised her arms. Twin jets of electricity lanced out, striking the vodka balls. They exploded with a bang, sending shards of glass flying everywhere. John cried out and flung his arms up over his face, ducking behind a chair.<br/>
<br/>
People were streaming out of the bar in droves, screaming and dashing for cover, and suddenly Gen was beside him, grabbing his arm and pulling him upright.<br/>
<br/>
"Get moving, Icarus!"<br/>
<br/>
"I'll have you know that I don't condone that action!" He groaned, getting to his feet and moving swiftly towards the door, vaulting an overturned table and dodging around a large support pole. The room was foggy with smoke from the explosion, and he soon lost sight of Gen, Cynthia and Max.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Where are you guys?</span> The thought urgently--hoping that Gen at least, who he of course knew was telepathic, would respond.<br/>

        <p class="post"> As people cascaded out of the building, the girl who had caused the ruckus stood still in the middle of the mess. Her tight-fitting black clothing was dusted with glass shards. Fortunately it had protected her—all except her uncovered face. She felt a trickle of blood run down her cheek, and her eyes burned from the smoke. <span style="font-style: italic;">Oh, what an idiot! Daydreaming about getting high marks from The Master when I should have been focusing on my task! And now they escaped!</span><br/>
<br/>
Or did they? As soon as she couldn’t see anyone else, the girl hopped lightly over the table and peered around the corner. She couldn't see anyone, but they might have a spy hidden. So she mastered her face into the most frightened, humiliated expression she could think of and slunk out the door. <br/>
<br/>
Although her head was dropped in feigned despair, her eyes were very lively, scanning around the deserted square. Dragging her feet, she went off to the right and around behind the building. The path was overgrown, but she could still recognize it. So, pushing her way through bushes and giant weeds, she vanished over the brow of the hill.<br/>
<br/>
There she paused. She sat down beneath a sheltering tree and leaned against its trunk, taking a deep breath. She reached for her pack and pulled out a small mirror, in which she examined her face.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, the flying glass had given her only a slight cut beneath her right eye, but she knew from long drilling that even the slightest wound could carry a scent for tracking. She cleaned it with salve and wiped the blood off with a rag, which she stuck in the tree to foil trackers. She reached deeper into her pouch and—the instructions! They were gone!<br/>
<br/>
This can’t be happening! There was a hole in the bottom of the pack. Obviously the instructions had slipped out during the ruckus, some time. Quickly the girl looked around. She didn’t see anyone, so she headed back the way she came. Only this time she went through the bushes. She was so quiet that she didn’t even disturb a pair of birds three feet away. She smiled. This, indeed, was her area of expertise. <br/>
<br/>
The instructions were so important, too! They had her name right at the top—“Sabrina”—written in the bold, flowing cursive of The Master. She would have to go all the way back into the building. Hopefully there wasn’t a cleanup squad there already. One of the escaping guests could have alerted someone. Sabrina doubled her pace and this time scared a bird.<br/>
<br/>
She went over the top of the hill. There was the building, and it looked as deserted as before. Sabrina stood and ran on tiptoe down to the back and around the corner of the building. A window was open. It was high up and she could barely reach it, but she placed her hands on the sill and sprang upwards. As she ducked inside her ponytail braid brushed against the top of the window, sweeping aside some cobwebs.<br/>
<br/>
Before jumping down, Sabrina checked the room briefly. Nobody was in sight. She hopped lightly down and began searching among the rubbish spread on the floor. It was a white packet, with the red seal of The Master on it. It would be very noticeable…to others as well as to herself. </p>

<br/>
The smoke was clearing, revealing the room to be in pieces, almost literally. Trampled chairs and broken tables were strewn over the floor; the bar had been vandalized during the panic, and broken glass littered the floor. A tall, shadowy figure was leaning against the doorframe, nursing a gashed arm and black eye. John pulled back the sleeve of his military jacket, revealing a deep, ragged wound where the glass had gotten him. Gritting his teeth and narrowing his coal-black eyes to slits, he raised his right hand, which began to crackle with electricity. He flicked his fingers, took a deep breath, and pressed his charged hand onto the wound.<br/>
<br/>
"SSsssshhh! Ah! Ooh, that's gunna hurt tomorrow." He winced and pulled his sleeve down, his brow furrowed in thought. <span style="font-style: italic;">Where are they? I can't stay here much longer....</span><br/>
<br/>
A noise across the smoky room made him look up. A girl--the same one from earlier--was crawling through the window. He watched as she jumped lightly to the floor, marveling at the way she remained silent, even when falling from such a height. The Master trained his pupils well. He watched as she began to rummage through the trash on the floor, and his frown deepened.<br/>
<br/>
"Looking for this," he called, stepping forward out of the smoke, "Sabrina?"<br/>
<br/>
Her head snapped up, and her eyes widened as she saw the snow-white pamphlet that he was clutching in one long-fingered hand. "No!" she snarled, leaping to her feet. </p>

<br/>
(Hopefully this segment won't mess anything up too badly?)<br/>
<br/>
Max saw the table flip out of the corner of his eye. Caught a glimpse of the strange woman dressed in black, noted the immediately explosive reaction by Cynthia and John and in a wave of panic shoved himself away from the bar, knocking over his half-filled glass and tore for the same direction as his companions. Smoke quickly filled the room, clouding visibilities and encouraging hysteria as the two explosives burst into a painful shower of antiseptic glass.<br/>
<br/>
Max fell into the swell of chaos and happened to steal a glance of Gen's silvered hair heading for the door after grabbing at John, but losing him in the surge. He pushed his way through the crowd towards her, but then she disappeared into the square. Max was shorter than the average person his age, so he could slip through the center of the crowd and as soon as he ran through the exit he moved towards the center of the square, spinning around in place until he saw Cynthia running away from him, disappearing behind a red-brick building and into a thin alleyway.<br/>
<br/>
He darted after her, refusing the urge to shout her name. She wouldn't hear him anyway, he was far out of earshot and it looked like she knew exactly where she was going. <span style="font-style: italic;">Probably trailing Gen. She moves fast.</span> He collided with a pair of teenagers but managed to roll off them with a quick apology and ran faster after the pair of his companions. <span style="font-style: italic;">Where's John?</span> The thought wormed its way into his immediate thoughts, but he told himself that he would naturally be with Gen! Although... He turned his head back at the bar, now mostly empty but the smoke had followed the patrons out the door.<br/>
<br/>
He turned back and leaped over the curbside and shoved a fallen trashcan out of his way. He paused at the entrance of the alleyway before convincing himself that she did run this way and followed their trail. As he ran out of the alleyway an SUV rolled past him at an easy pace, but he couldn't see either of the girls on the street.<br/>
<br/>
"Gen! Cyn!" He cupped his hands around his mouth. "Cynthia! Gen!" His voice echoed off the walls, but without a reply. He tried to think which way they would most likely go- they would be running, but not that far away without him, and the ship wasn't exactly "near", either. You can't land a spaceship without a lot of people noticing it, and the only truly 'empty' place was at least a half-mile from the bar. He turned right and followed the road- he would head towards the plot of land called the Hangar.<br/>

The "No!" popped out unexpectedly. Sabrina sprang to her feet and stood still, staring at the envelope clutched in John's hand. For a moment she sized him up. He was two feet taller than she was, and he looked like the same species as the dangerous one who had blown glass all over the room, so he probably had the same powers. Sabrina decided to play it cool--for the moment. She could feel the daggers strapped to her legs, and she was always safe with those. Besides, with her heightened reflexes, if necessary she could pin him to the floor--if she moved fast enough. She took a deep breath. <br/>
<br/>

He returned the smile, his eyes crinkling.<br/>
"Someone dropped it. You wouldn't happen to know who, would you?"<br/>
<br/>
Quietly he stepped forward, fiddling with the phamplet in his hand, the glass under his feet crunching with every footfall. "You are Sabrina, correct? Otherwise you wouldn't have responded to your name." His eyes softened. "You need to be more careful, a little slip up like that gives everything away."<br/>
<br/>
She stared at him, then stood up. "Just give me the phamplet, and we'll call it even."<br/>
<br/>
He stopped, staring down at her with a sad look in his eye. "You don't have to follow him, you know," he said quietly. "We can help you. Come with us. We aren't what they've taught you we are."<br/>

He tucked the pamphlet into his coat pocket and held out one hand, with hopeful eyes and an open face.<br/>

Gen skidded to a halt, bending over and gasping for breath. They--she and Cynthia, had reached the hangar unscathed. She just hoped that Max and John had done so as well. She had tried to tag the two of them, but in all the confusion they had been separated. <span style="font-style: italic;">I hope I didn't kill them....</span> None of the glass pieces had been big enough, though. Speaking of which....<br/>
<br/>
"Ouch, Gen! A little warning next time?"<br/>
<br/>
Cynthia was examining a gash on her shoulder. Gen shrugged. "Sorry. Did what I had to in the moment." Something caught her eye and she leaped up. "Is that Max?" </p>

He crouched down in the broken glass, taking off his glasses and polishing them thoughtfully. "We can help you lead a free life. One where no one tells you what to do every moment. Sound appealing?"<br/>

His lips twitched as he slipped his glasses back on. "And I may definitely be tall, but last time I looked, I'm not "big"." He patted his stomach and smirked, speaking almost to himself. "Not yet, anyway. Halen's cooking is threatening to kill me."<br/>

He glanced back up at her from his vulnerable position. "It's your choice, but either way I'm taking this with me." He patted his pocket. </p>

The glass clinked and crunched beneath his flimsy body as he went down, the girl perched on his chest, the blade of a knife pressed against his throat. He swallowed, feeling the razor point press that much closer. His black eyes rose to meet hers.<br/>
"Please reconsider," he said quietly, and although his voice was (mostly) calm the steely look in her eye and the eagerness with which she wielded her weapon made his heart pound in his throat.<br/>
"Not a chance," she hissed, her voice laden with determination and cold desire.<br/>
Silently he reached an arm up and clasped a spidery hand around the blade of the dagger. A flash of electricity ran over his fingers, into the metal, and onto the girl's arm. She fell back with a yelp and John scrabbled backwards, leaping to his feet with the dagger still clasped in his now bleeding hand.<br/>
"It was worth a shot!" He called, then turned and ran for the door. Unbeknownst to him, she had a replacement. </p>

        <p class="post"> Sabrina took a deep breath and wrenched herself to her feet, gritting her teeth as her body still crackled with electricity. She reached for her other dagger and threw it. But some sixth sense seemed to warn him, and he dodged to the side. The dagger screamed by half an inch from his neck.<br/>
<br/>
Sabrina knew there was no point trying to chase him down. The last thing she wanted to do was attract attention. So she reached into her pack and pulled out one of the emergency messages. She wrote in it, "Tracking down The Enemy. Will give further details soon. S." She activated the message and vanished out the door, and the building was quiet. </p>

        <p class="post"> Cynthia felt her pocket buzz, but tried not to notice. "I hope it's nothing important from The Master, she hoped. Gen, Max and John didn't know...and they couldn't find out, or the United Universe would fail and she'd have The Master's scorn." She thought. <br/>
<br/>
"Hey Gen, I'm going to go inside and patch myself up." She said, walking inside. She briskly walked in the restroom and closed and locked the stall, then, reaching into her pocket she read Sabina's message. "Good." She said smiling slyly. <br/>
She sent a message of her own, "I have them where I want them, no suspicions. C."<br/>
She then laid her hand on her wounds, instantly the glass disappeared and the blood vanished, her tan skin looked as if nothing had happened. That was the only power Gen and Max knew she had, the rest were a mystery known only to herself and The Master. </p>

        <p class="post"> Sabrina stopped. Someone had replied. She checked her messages. What? Cynthia was with them? Well, of course. Why hadn't she recognized her? For a moment anger welled up inside her. This was her own mission, and she didn't want Cynthia butting in. Then she remembered what The Master had said during their last fight. "What's more important? You individuals, or the success of the United Universe?" They had instantly made up and apologized to him. The Master had smiled thinly and passed out of the room.<br/>
<br/>
Swallowing her disappointment, Sabrina replied, "Need me to come along, or is there something more important I need to do elsewhere? You needn't worry about my spying skills, you know." <br/>
<br/>
This last was a personal nudge, a challenge, in a way. They were on the same team, but they were rivals. Sabrina waited outside the building in the shade. </p>

        <p class="post"> Max leaned a steadying hand against one of the rare boulders nestled in the area and drew his breath under control. It had been a relatively easy jog from the bar, except for a few minor inconveniences, like turning left when he should have turned right, or the hill that hides the two-ship hangar from the road out of the city. The Hangar was in the middle of a clearing in a heavily wooded area, and that wide open space at the entrance would make VTOL a breeze, if there was ever a VTOL-craft within their possession.<br/>
<br/>
He pushed off the rock and ran the last stretch until the grass and dirt turned into the hard cement of their hidden garage, stopping next to Gen at the entrance as Cynthia went into the restroom. "Well, at least you didn't leave without me... Is John here? I lost sight of him in the smoke." </p>

        <p class="post"> As Cynthia entered the building, a sudden noise made Gen look up, and a smile curl over her face. Max was jogging the last lengths toward them.<br/>
<br/>
"Well, at least you didn't leave without me..." He called, skidding to a panting halt. "Is John here? I lost sight of him in the smoke."<br/>
<br/>
A jolt of panic ran like electricity through her chest, and she straightened up. "What?! No! I thought he was with you!" She began rapidly fiddling with a communicator in one of the pockets of her military jacket.<br/>
<br/>
"If that idiot gets himself killed, I swear by everything holy..." She trailed off, then clutched a hunk of her silver hair with one hand, the other quivering around the communicator, whether through incredulity or rage, no one could tell.<br/>
<br/>
"He's still in the square." She said flatly, then turned and grasped Max's shoulders, shaking them roughly. "He's still in the square! Great! What do I tell Elise? He's probably been shot or trampled!" She reached quickly for her pack, muttering under her breath. "And if he hasn't, he soon will be."<br/>
_________________________________________<br/>
<br/>
"That was close!" Dropping the bloody dagger to the floor with a clatter, John sprinted across the square. The dagger had just missed his throat, but by some miracle, quite unusual for him, he had managed to escape it.<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Failed. Again. Despite all your best efforts, you're not making any difference, aside from in the likelihood of your living a long life.</span> he sighed in frustration, wheeling around a corner so fast he lost his footing and came crashing to the ground. <span style="font-style: italic;">Clutz!</span> he thought, <span style="font-style: italic;">but not too clumsy.</span> his hand went to the phamplet in his pocket, and he staggered up, starting out for the woods. "At least I got what we came for."<br/>
As he fled the courtyard, he did not notice a dark shadow, standing under the awnings of a crumbling house, watching with one green eye as he passed....<br/>
_________________________________________<br/>
<br/>
The communicator buzzed three times before he answered. He quickly wished he hadn't.<br/>
<br/>
"WHERETHEHECKAREYOU?! WHYDIDNTYOUFOLLOWUS?! YOURE SUCH AN IDIOT, I SHOULD FIND ANOTHER PILOT AND LEAVE YOU HERE TO THE MASTERS MINIONS AND THE WILD BEASTS AND A SET OF ANGRY TREES! WITH SNAPPY BRANCHES! LIKE WHIPS! LIKE WHIPS, DO YOU HEAR ME?"<br/>
<br/>
"I had to try, Gen! It isn't like it hasn't been done before!"<br/>
<br/>
There was a pause, then: "YOURE TELLING ME YOU TRIED DIPLOMACY WITH HER? ARE YOU INSANE? THAT NEVER WORKS AND IT WONT NOW AND IT WONT EVER IN THE FUTURE SO STOP TRYING AND START USING THAT BIG HEAD OF YOURS TO GET YOURSELF <span style="font-style: italic;">OUT</span> OF SITUATIONS, NOT FURTHER IN!"<br/>
<br/>
"Oh, look who's talking!" He said hotly, darting down an alleyway and up a flight of stairs. "When I discovered you, you were more brainwashed than she was, and by much worse, I might add!"<br/>
<br/>
"DO NOT BRING OUR BROTHER INTO THIS! THIS ISNT ABOUT HIM, ITS ABOUT YOU AND YOUR STUPIDITY AND RIGHT NOW IM GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT."<br/>
<br/>
"Gen--" there was a sharp movement up ahead, and John skidded to a halt. "Er, can I call you back?"<br/>
<br/>
"WHAT?! NO! DONT YOU DARE PUT ME ON HOL--"<br/>
<br/>
"Little busy right now, bye!" He whispered quickly, before darting into a doorway. Someone was stalking towards him, and he guessed that they weren't coming bearing Christmas wishes....<br/>
_________________________________________<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, back in the square, Cynthia was still standing talking into the communication device.<br/>
<br/>
"You needn't worry about my spying skills, you know."<br/>
<br/>
Something moved in the corner of the square, in the deepest of the shadows. Something tall, thin, and enshrouded in black.<br/>
<br/>
"Got a light? No, don't suppose you do. I just missed the one who did. Just my luck."<br/>
<br/>
A woman stepped from the shadows. She looked like she was in her late twenties, maybe early thirties. Her face had the hard, beaten look of a soldier who's seen better days: her left eye was nearly blinded by a long, thin scar running beneath it, while the other eye was completely gone, replaced with a brass eyepiece, the glass of which was a dark, forest green, quite unlike her natural eye which was an unsettling neon of the same color, her black hair fell in ragged locks in bangs and around her face, at least, that which wasn't tamped down by the leather strap of her eyepiece--the rest of her ragged hair reaching just below her shoulders.<br/>
She wore a deep sable double breasted greatcoat and leather fingerless gloves, in one of the hands of which was clasped a cigarette.<br/>
<br/>
She glanced Sabrina up and down and nodded. "Hmm. So you follow the master, eh? Never did like following anyone myself. That's how I ended up here.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Do</span> you have a light?<br/>

        <p class="post"> Sabrina stared at the boy. Her mind spun. She had never seen anyone with teleportation skills that quick! She had just mentally placed the tall woman in the "Sarcastic and Proud and Dangerous, Requires Intimidation" class, and this had unsettled even her. If she made a mistake she could end up being teleported to The Master-only-knows-where. So she decided to play the big sister card.<br/>
<br/>
"Oh! Well, that's not nice. Why did you teleport that woman? We were just starting a conversation!" she said. "Besides, I don't generally use teleportation; I get motion sick very easily. Thank you for the offer, though!" She tensed herself for a sudden move in case this Leo proved un-negotiable. </p>

Then everything went fuzzy and blurry, and suddenly she found herself standing on the edge of a parapet far above the ground.<br/>
<br/>
"Fizzle ticks!" She snarled, windmilling her arms as she tried to balance herself out. "Darn teleports!"<br/>
Slowly, she sunk down, careful to avoid pitching over backwards, as the parapet, more like a wall, was only about two feet wide. Pretzeling her legs, she stared flatly at her cigarette.<br/>
<br/>
"Great. Now what."<br/>
<br/>
All of a sudden she felt her scalp begin to prickle, and her hair to stand up statically. Her gaze flicked down to the alley below, and what she saw made her sit up to attention.<br/>
<br/>
The lanky Zeranorian whom she had seen fleeing from the square was pressed back against a dumpster, discharging massive amounts of energy at a man with what looked like a high powered grenade launcher. It looked like they were at a stalemate--the Zeranorian's electricity was keeping the gun from working properly, but she knew from experience with the species that he couldn't keep it up for long.<br/>
<br/>
She leaped to her feet, then with an almighty roar launched herself off of the edge of the building, making the two fighters glance up.<br/>
<br/>
As she fell, her form rippled, growing larger, her arms elongating and legs twisting into an unnatural shape, while her face lengthened. A pair of sharp, notched ears sprouted from the top of her head and her black clothing melted into coarse, black fur. The ground cracked beneath her feet, now enormous paws, as she landed.<br/>
Between them stood a fully grown wolf.<br/>

No sooner had Sabrina said the words when she heard a huge roaring noise coming from her right--toward the place where John had run just minutes before. " 'Scuse me," she said, "I'm busy." She snatched up the knife stained with blood that she had been eyeing for the past thirty seconds and slipped it into the scabbard on her left leg. Then she pulled a rope from her pack and threw it onto a hook jutting out of the wall behind her. She swung up onto the roof, replaced the rope in her pack, and ran along the top of the building. She came to the edge and peered down. There was her recent almost-captive, and there was a stranger blasting at him. Then Sabrina saw the huge wolf on the ground. <br/>
<br/>
Something seemed vaguely familiar about the wolf, and her intuition told her it was not ordinary. "It might help me get my instructions back!" she thought. Then, "I wonder where that Leo went!" </p>

        <p class="post"> John staggered back. There was a wolf standing in front of him. He froze, electricity flickering on his fingertips as it turned, it's one eye staring straight into his, as if t were looking into his soul. Then it turned and snarled at the RPG wielding man.<br/>
<br/>
"Get back!" he yelped, "go on, you brute!"<br/>
<br/>
Her eye widened and a snarl ripped across her muzzle.<br/>
<br/>
"<span style="font-style: italic;">Call me a brute, do you? I'll show you a thing or two!</span>"<br/>
<br/>
She lunged forward, jaws wide and eye glaring, and John darted past her, lunging for the attacker's gun. As his hands closed around the metal, something caught his eye. Sabrina was standing on the building above them, staring down, her eyes fixed on the wolf.<br/>
<br/>
He wrenched the RPG away from the attacker, almost falling under its enormous weight. Hoisting it up on his shoulder, he put the scope to his eye, and began jabbing buttons, but it was unlike any Zeranorian weapon he had ever used.<br/>
<br/>
"This one? No... That can't be right..."<br/>

"Hum," Gen replied, "Siblings. Let's get the ship ready, we'll have to go pick him up."<br/>

She leaped out of the restroom and into the hangar. There lay a ship, small but sturdy looking, with a fighter pilot style bridge.<br/>
Gen propelled herself up the boarding dock and launched through the halls to the bridge.<br/>
<br/>
"Open the bay doors."<br/>

He'd figured it out.<br/>
<br/>
Ka-BOOM!<br/>
The kick sent the RPG way off course, striking the side of the building about twenty feet up.<br/>
"Oops... Hang on...."<br/>
<br/>
"Out of luck. Give me back my instructions."<br/>
<br/>
Sabrina was leaping towards him, wielding the same bloody dagger that he had snatched from her before.<br/>
<br/>
In a panicked impulse he closed his eyes and swung the enormous gun at her oncoming form.<br/>

        <p class="post"> John staggered, the gun vanishing from his grasp. He raised his hands as Sabrina came on, the dagger raised to meet his flesh. Then--<br/>
A buzzing filled his ears. He staggered backwards, unable to hear, a dizziness flooding his head.<br/>
He slumped against Sabrina, unable to find his balance.<br/>
<br/>
"This is what you've brought me?"<br/>
<br/>
A voice broke through the bussing in his ears, and he glanced up.<br/>
The Master.<br/>
<br/>
"It is weak."<br/>
<br/>
The eyes in the cold face narrowed, and John bared his teeth.<br/>
"Strong enough!" He raised his chin proudly, shaking the dizziness  from his head and standing straight. He looked around, gauging the room, then sizing up Leo and Sabrina. The supports were made of metal... If he could electrify them, then he might be able to stun them and get away.<br/>

        <p class="post"> Max had been on his way to run some pre-flight tests as Gen went in to talk with Cynthia, to make sure that John hadn't changed the whole system to his own preferences again, one of his worst habits. He was just finishing up readjusting the tension on the yoke as Gen came up the boarding-ramp and commanded to open the bay-doors. "I read ya," <span style="font-style: italic;">sir.</span> He smirked to himself and depressed the orange bubble of a button that sent a radio sequence into the receivers which had been installed into the large bay door.<br/>
<br/>
With a groan and the shriek of moving metal, the gears and mechanisms brought the two-feet thick riveted wall of metal up into a hidden crevice in the ceiling and the engine of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Slyght Varyance</span> roared to life with the force of an aircraft twice her size. Max reached up to the black radio cradled above him.<br/>
<br/>
"This is your captain speaking-"<br/>
"Stop speaking, and start flying!" Gen shouted from behind him, she and Cynthia settling in for the flight.<br/>
Max couldn't think of a reasonable argument so he shrugged and flicked a few switches interspersed with some button-mashing and then gripped the flying-yoke.<br/>
"Here we go, ladies..."<br/>
<br/>
The plane started rolling forward as the engines warmed and the propellers slowly spun-up to maximum velocity.<br/>
"Everything looks good." He thought aloud. "We good back there?"<br/>
Cynthia looked at Gen, an odd flickering that was quickly gone. "Of course we are."<br/>
Gen cocked an eyebrow and felt her head twitch, but she nodded. "Yes, Max."<br/>
"Then we are going airborne." He pushed the lever off to his side forward, tilting the propellers into a full-blown whirlwind pushing the aircraft the rest of the way out of the Hangar and onto the grassy field.<br/>
<br/>
Due to the lack of real "take-off" space, Max and John had put their heads together and structured something quite ingenious: a ramp, laid into the side of the hill covered by a grassy-tarp which receded by command of a light-beam sensor set to be broken as the aircraft's nose pushed through the beam as it inched out of the hangar, and then to reinitialize the camouflage after five minutes time. One of the previous times Max took the plane out, he had accelerated too quickly and the landing gear brought a section of the grass-covering with it; shredding the strip and dislocating the recess and its gears. The grass had been solidly lodged in the wheels' compartment as the trees scored the underbelly of the plane, not to mention the one tree that had obviously moved of its own evil nature to stand directly in his "landing" plan, wrecking the port-side wing... at least two-and-a-half weeks' repair in all. Maybe three, as John liked to point out.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, he had learned from his mistake, and now properly timed himself on each takeoff; exampled by the wheels accelerating up the paved blacktop and then receding into their small compartments as the wings took the weight off and lifted the plane into the air.<br/>
<br/>
"Another successful takeoff.", Max complimented himself as he leaned back in comfort. </p>

Gen smirked, sitting back in her seat. "Just get us there in one piece, or need I remind you--"<br/>
"--no need to rub it in..."<br/>
She leaned back as Max took them up.<br/>
"Max, how long till we can claim our ship?"<br/>
<br/>
"If the merchant isn't trying to con us, in about a week."<br/>
<br/>
Gen clicked her tongue. "Not fast enough. Are we there yet?"<br/>
<br/>
"One moment..."<br/>
<br/>
Ten minutes later the plane's wheels rammed down into the ground, bringing them to a rapid halt.<br/>
Gen stiffened herself to stop from getting whiplash. She shook herself as she stood up.<br/>
"We have to fix the straight landings."<br/>
<br/>
They had landed in the middle of the large square, from which they had fled earlier. Gen stepped down from the plane, casting a glance furiously around.<br/>
<br/>
"Where is he?" Max and Cynthia stepped from the craft, looking around warily.<br/>
<br/>
"JOHN! JOHN WHERE ARE YOU?!"<br/>
<br/>
"He's not here."<br/>
From a nearby alleyway the black haired woman emerged. Gen's eyes narrowed.<br/>
<br/>
"OH YEAH? WHERE IS HE THEN?! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH HIM, YOU FEIND?! IF YOU AND YOUR UNITED UNIVERSE CRONIES HAVE KILLED HIM--"<br/>
<br/>
"Relax, I didn't touch him. And I don't follow anyone. Not my style." She pulled a cigarette from her pocket and held it out. "Light?"<br/>
<br/>
Gen stared at her stonily, apparently too angry even for words. The woman sighed and leaned back.<br/>
<br/>
"The name's Shade. You can stand down, I'm not going to bite your leg off."<br/>
<br/>
They stared at her. She looked down at herself, then back up. "Forgot that happened. Never mind, forget what I just said. I might bite your leg off."<br/>
<br/>
"Where. Is. John?"<br/>
<br/>
Shade shrugged. "Dunno, do I? There I was, fighting alongside him, when all of a sudden they vanished. Poof!" She flung her arms out. "Like that! Spect they took him to one of their hidey holes."<br/>

It was here that Leo decided to teleport himself to the packet,<br/>
But as he could only use one teleport every so long he asked Sabrina to come with him to recover the packet. <br/>

She turned to the Master and said "we leave this creature *with a shudder of disgust* in your capable hands," and she turned back to Leo "I am ready, let's go" </p>

In her hand was the white phamplet. Gen took it gingerly, staring at that which had caused them so much trouble.<br/>
<br/>
"You mean he's gone?" Gen asked, a sudden quietness in her voice.<br/>
<br/>
"Not dead! Just vanished," Shade shrugged, sticking the cigarette in her mouth and snapping her fingers. "Teleported, by my guess."<br/>
<br/>
Gen opened her mouth, then shut it. Then suddenly a light came on in her eyes.<br/>
"We can track him."<br/>
<br/>
She turned around. "Max, get the plane up and running. Cynthia, contact the dealer. We can't wait for the ship to be ready--have them prep it for departure. Charge it to my card, I don't care. And you," she turned to Shade, who was still trying to get her cigarette lit. "Come with us, when they realize that he hasn't cot the phamplet, they'll come swarming back."<br/>

Shade smirked and raised a hand in mock salute. "Aye captain. Not that I can't take care of myself, thank you very much."<br/>

"Zip it!" Sabrina squirmed back. It was very dark. Her heightened senses detected something falling, but she stepped back too late. She crumpled to the ground, something very heavy on her leg. Fortunately it had fallen softly, but now she was stuck. At least she could move her arms, but the heavy thing was so large she could not move it by herself.<br/>

"Leo!" she hissed. There was no answer. <br/>

        <p class="post"> "Oh it'll be fine." Gen said, shrugging off the fact that the engine was only just functional.<br/>
<br/>
"Can I see the pamphlet?"<br/>
<br/>
Gen glanced at her, then withdrew the sheaf of white paper from  her pocket, handing it over. "Gaze to your heart's content! This is what we've been hunting these past few months. It took about an entire armada last time to retrieve one of these. We're lucky we got it."<br/>
<br/>
She turned away again, her face darkening. "Lets go. I want to find John as soon as possible."<br/>
<br/>
"But how are you going to find him?" Cynthia asked, cocking her head to one side. Gen reached into her pocket and withdrew the tracker.<br/>
<br/>
"With this. If he still has his on, then we should be able to find him. On-world or no."<br/>
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br/>
<br/>
Shade sauntered into the cockpit, leaning over Max's shoulder. "So, you the man with the plan... the bloke behind the spokes?" She frowned. "That doesn't really make much sense, does it?"<br/>
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br/>
<br/>
John stared around him in bewilderment. His captors had vanished, leaving him alone with the one who called himself the Master. His eyes alighted on the door behind him, then flickered to the man who was still registering what had just happened. It was now or never.<br/>
With a sudden movement, he flung his arms out, discharging as much electricity as he could muster in every direction. it lanced out, striking the walls, floor, ceiling, and the Master. Without waiting to see what had happened, John turned and made a run for it.<br/>
He flew across the long hall, his footfalls muffled by the soft, velvet rug beneath his feet. He hit the door, unable to stop, then reached for the handle (curiously shaped like a dragon, he noticed). But before his long fingers had closed around it's rough surface, there was a tug in the small of his back and he went flying backwards into one of the tall marble pillars.<br/>
The floor met him with a sickening thud, and he lay there, the wind knocked from him, his head smarting terribly.<br/>
<br/>
"Did you honestly think you would get away?" The voice was harsh, cold. Coughing, the pilot pushed himself off of the ground, staring hazily at the red-clothed figure walking towards him. A flutter of fear started in his chest. He had to get away...<br/>
<br/>
"GAHHH!" This time he focused his electricity on the Master. He stopped, his eyes closing, then swiped a hand sideways. John went flying in the other direction, this time crashing against the far wall. Trying to ignore the ringing in his ears and the increasing difficulty of standing, he staggered forward, flinging a burst of high-powered energy at the red-clothed figure. The Master stopped again, then stared with a disappointed look in his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
"I expected better from the rebels. It seems my adversaries are just as weak as I make them out to be."<br/>
And before John could even move, he had flicked his wrist again, and the pilot had crashed into the throne upon which the Master had formerly been seated. Completely spent, John slithered to the floor, falling limply to his knees. He ached all over and his nose was bleeding. And the Master was still coming.<br/>
<br/>
"I got the pamphlet from you though." He coughed, a smirk curling across his face. "Not so weak after all."<br/>
<br/>
"It will soon be retrieved."<br/>
<br/>
The pilot looked up into those dark, icy eyes, then the Master twitched his wrist, and everything went black.<br/>
<br/>
* * *<br/>
<br/>
 "Sabrina, come back at once! I did not give you permission to leave."<br/>
<br/>
"I'm sorry sir!"<br/>
<br/>
"What about the alien?" Another voice spoke.<br/>
<br/>
The Master glanced down at his feet, where the lanky pilot was lying, one arm bent out awkwardly. "It has been... dealt with. Return immediately." </p>

        <p class="post"> Sabrina's message came in on her communicator. Quietly she replied, "My new bud Leo teleported John--is that the tall chap?--to the stronghold. Now I'm in the same area as you are, but invisible--I guess. Where are you?" She sent the message and heard voices to her right. <br/>
<br/>
Cynthia quickly responded, "I'm on the ship, flying, not exactly sure where we're at...Gen is able to track John with some device, see if you can find it and remove it. I have the pamphlet. C." <br/>
<br/>
She slowly opened the pamphlet, gazing at the slippery cursive she knew so well. "What do I do with it?" She asked herself, folding it over in her hand. "At least it doesn't have my name on it.." She finally decided to discreetly fold it and put it in her pocket. </p>

Then she saw John lying on the floor. Blood had pooled around him and he was completely still. <br/>

Something welled up in Sabrina's heart that she had never felt before. She turned her face to The Master's. "Why…what…is he dead? Why…?" </p>

<br/>
"Humph," she said, looking him up and down, "Aye, <span style="font-style: italic;">sir</span>." Shade trotted out to the entrance, poking her head out the door. "Time to go."<br/>
<br/>
She stood back as Gen and Cynthia filed through, then found their seats. She watched them for a moment, then sat pretzel-legged on the floor.<br/>
<br/>
"Aren't you going to sit somewhere? It could get bumpy." Cynthia said, looking over her shoulder at her with a raised eyebrow.<br/>
<br/>
Shade shrugged and pulled out a cigarette. "I'll be fine, trust me."<br/>
<br/>
The girl shrugged. "You're funeral."<br/>

The light hurt his eyes as it shone through his lids, florescent, luminescent, brilliant. He groaned and raised a hand slowly to shield them from the blinding light, the light that was making his head throb painfully. Slowly he came to himself.<br/>
The walls around him were smooth, windowless, cold to the touch. Above him the light shone down through a glass window that made up the ceiling. Upon further inspection he discovered that the ceiling was the only exit--there was a little grille in one wall for talking, and through which food and water could be pushed.<br/>
<br/>
When the pain in his head had passed a little, and he found that he hadn't actually perished, he sat up--with some difficulty, and leaned back against the cold wall to take stock of the situation. He was trapped in an observation cell in who knows where, with no way of contacting Gen.<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Gen</span> he closed his eyes, groaning and leaning his head back against the smooth metal. <span style="font-style: italic;">Don't follow me. Its not worth it.</span> He knew she couldn't hear him, but it made him feel better to say it.<br/>
And speaking of feeling better--<br/>
<br/>
"AHRG!" He had tried to shift position, and discovered rather suddenly that his arm was badly broken. Probably a few ribs as well, and who knew what else. He moaned and lay back, staring morosely up at the ceiling window.<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic;">No aid, no food, no friends. I'll probably just rot here, or die of blood loss. I--</span><br/>
<br/>
His pocket buzzed.<br/>
After a furtive glance at the window, he reached into his pocket. The cool metal of the communicator/tracker met his touch and he almost leaped out of the cot in which he was seated. Gen was tracking him!<br/>
Quickly, before anything else happened, he slipped the communicator down into the lining of his boot. Whatever happened now, at least she had a lock on his coordinates. This could prove more fruitful than they could have dreamed.<br/>
A wave of dizziness overtook him, and he lay back, closing his eyes and taking a deep breath. Now all he would have to do would be to wait.<br/>
<br/>
* * *<br/>
<br/>
A rapping on the glass woke him. He stared glassily up, into the face of a youngish girl.<br/>
Sabrina.<br/>
<br/>
He didn't know what to think, or how he should be feeling. She was on the Master's side--<span style="font-style: italic;">her</span> people were keeping him captive. And yet... He hadn't quite given up on her, not just yet.<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic;">You're a sentamental fool.</span> He thought to himself, staring up and trying to ignore the pain of his arm. <span style="font-style: italic;">And if you keep on this warpath, you'll end up dead, just like your human-loving parents.</span> </p>

As soon as Sabrina saw John open his eyes, she sighed with relief. Then she stiffened. What was she doing, anyway? This was a deadly enemy! He stole her instructions, and they were almost gone except for Cynthia's--yes, really--wisdom. She'd been trying to kill him just two hours ago, and now…she didn't know what was going on. She had forgotten how to be truly human.<br/>
<br/>
But her feelings were starting to swing out of control.<br/>
<br/>
"You should just walk away. Sneer at him and go away. That's what The Master would want you to do," said one side of her head. "Or you could taunt him."<br/>
<br/>
"But…" said the other voice, the one that wasn't quite definable. It didn't know what it wanted.<br/>
<br/>
"He's scared of you, anyway," said the first voice. "Besides, he wouldn't believe you! You're a liar. Every other word you say is untrue. He wouldn't tell you anything."<br/>
<br/>
"That may be so, and it may not. He tried to turn me to his side! He can be trusting! He is not as bad as you think it is! There is another way!" said the other voice.<br/>
<br/>
"If The Master found you here, he would not be pleased!" said the first voice.<br/>
<br/>
"The Master doesn't need to know," hissed the second voice.<br/>
<br/>
The second voice won. <br/>
<br/>
Sabrina peered all around her. Nothing was in sight. In the tiniest whisper, she called, "John! You all right?" </p>

        <p class="post"> He stared up at her with slightly glazed eyes. What was she doing? She wasn't taunting him or making his condition worse, yet she wasn't trying to empathize or help him. She was just sitting there, staring right back. He turned his head sideways, trying to see her better. <span style="font-style: italic;">Is she all right? She can't have passed out or died--I would have noticed. I think.</span><br/>
Then all at once she shook herself, and leaned in towards the glass.<br/>
<br/>
"John! You all right?"<br/>
<br/>
The pilot blinked again and sat up a little straighter, careful not to move his arm. "I've been better," he winced. His black eyes, full of mistrust and a little sadness, met hers. "Why are you here? Has <span style="font-style: italic;">the Master</span> decided upon my fate yet?" his words <span style="font-style: italic;">were</span> sing-song and mocking, but not in particular of her.<br/>
<br/>
She stepped back. "The Master surely knows what your fate is."<br/>
<br/>
"I'm sure he does," John replied bitterly, straightening up and inspecting his broken arm. "I'm sure he knows z'actly what he would like to do with each and every one of us rebels."<br/>
<br/>
He winced again, pulling back his sleeve to reveal a bruised, bloodied patch on his arm. Quietly he gripped his forearm and took a deep breath.<br/>
He clenched his teeth, then let go. "I can't do it," he muttered, "nope. Nopey nope nope no. I'll wait for Cynthia when Gen and the others come. Which they will." He added to Sabrina, glancing up at her with his eyebrows raised and an almost innocent look on his face. "They will."<br/>

"Are we there yet?"<br/>
<br/>
Gens patience was wearing thin. Max kept fiddling with the navigator, a frown on his face. "Something is throwing the tracker off. It may be that they've installed a camouflage mechanism in the building's foundation--"<br/>
<br/>
"--Like the one we have at the hangar. Great. So now what?"<br/>
<br/>
Max scratched his chin thoughtfully. "I can take us down within the estimated area, but after that we'll have to find him "through senses alone," as it were."<br/>

Kago growled angrily, polishing his RPG. That dashed wolf! She'd slobbered all over it, not to mention the damage done by the Zeranorian's electricity. At least this one wasn't his favorite. Otherwise someone would have paid dearly, and not in the thousands of Currants that this device cost. He placed it gently down on its stand, then stood up, stretching his long arms to the ceiling. Long arms, shorter legs. People called him a baboon when he was young. "Primate" might as well have been his middle name. He curled his lip angrily. At least he was strong, not like that Zeranworian or the party-loving mother who had left him in his father's care. Worst decision ever.<br/>
<br/>
He shook himself and cast his eyes once more over his collection--his pride and joy. RPGs, Shotguns, and a beautiful 50 Cal that he had stolen from the hands of his mortal enemy as he lay dying. He smirked, and turned again toward the door.<br/>

"They will."<br/>
<br/>
Sabrina actually smiled. "Oh, yes," she said. "I'm sure they will." With another quick glance around, she pulled something out of her pouch. She applied it to the edge of the glass, and it soundlessly swung open. Sabrina grabbed the edge and landed in the room.<br/>
<br/>
John moved aside instinctively. Sabrina began pulling things out of her pack so quickly he couldn't keep track of them--little packets and bottles, mostly. She poured liquid from one bottle into a small glass. Then she opened a packet and poured a powder into it. She swirled the glass around and looked at it through the light. Then she looked at John.<br/>
<br/>
He looked right back at her, and she turned away. "I knew you wouldn't trust me. But really--" She paused, then took a quick sip of the liquid herself. She looked at him inquiringly and held the cup out. </p>

        <p class="post"> Cynthia knew John was hurt, she could empathize his pain. "We're almost there!" She cried, looking out down below, "We must hurry, John needs our help!" <br/>
Gen looked at her curiously, "How do you know?" <br/>
"I just do!" Cynthia snapped, "Max, can this thing go any faster?" <br/>
She knew The Master must have John in captivity, he couldn't defeat The Master. But he was vital to her mission, they needed him with them, not The Master, if he died...<br/>
The Master knew this, maybe he would hand him over to them...she knew she needed to heal him soon, he wouldn't last long losing blood. </p>

"I just do!" Cynthia snapped, "Max, can this thing go any faster?"<br/>
"Not if we want to keep ourselves discreetly hidden from prying eyes- but if we don't care about that anymore, I-... Hang on." He set the yoke into a locked position and gently pushed past the two girls and opened the overhead compartment in the hallway that was holding all sorts of maps and measuring devices. He stood on his tip-toes and stretched for the pair of binoculars at the very back of the cabinet, managing to snag the faux-leather strap and yank it towards him.<br/>
<br/>
Gen stepped to the side as he returned to the piloting chair and raised the binoculars to his eyes, surveying the land a far way's ahead of them. "I found us a landing zone, but you're still going to have to trek a little ways to actually get to the site, judging from the last coordinates that we got before it went all fuzzy." He released the Yoke's lock and started slowly lessening their distance to the ground. "I'll stay with the plane in case they have patrolling units and need to relocate, or things start to get hot and you need a quick get-away." He decelerated the plane's thrust and opened the landing gears as the distant trees grew larger, and started to come closer to the fragile aircraft.<br/>
<br/>
Finally the wheels hit dirt and the ship jostled about for a minute or two as Max swerved to accommodate their tight quarters.<br/>
"Are we anywhere near where we're supposed to be?" </p>

I love it when I can make myself dream about my characters and RP situations, and what happens next and who's doing what \o/ I'm always daydreaming about what terrible things to do to John DX)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He watched warily as she mixed the strange smelling liquid, then held it out to him.<br/>
<br/>
"I knew you wouldn't trust me. But really--"<br/>
<br/>
He watched the cup rise to her lips, then blinked. She smiled and held it out. Gingerly he took it, and downed it in one gulp. Almost immediately he felt a warmth stretch through his twisted arm and broken ribs--he almost couldn't feel the pain anymore. Quickly, before he could think twice about it, he grabbed his forearm and set the broken bone with a crack. He blinked slowly then looked back up at her.<br/>
<br/>
"Got any bandages in that handy dandy bag of yours?" He asked quietly, a half smile twitching across his face. She mirrored the look and reached into the bag. And that's when it happened.<br/>
And that's when it happened.<br/>
<br/>
John happened to glance up, and his eyes met Leo's. The telaporter stared at them with wide eyes, then turned and ran. Without a moments hesitation John leaped up, latching onto the ledge and heaving himself over the edge into the open. Leo hadn't teleported--he was still running down the length of the hall. John's lips curled into a snarl and he raised his hands, discharging an enormous amount of energy into Leo. The boy twitched, then keeled over. Trembling on his feet, John staggered towards him, and knelt down. He had a pulse--the electricity had knocked him out cold.<br/>
<br/>
Sabrina's head was poking out of the entrance. For one moment, John had the fleeting impulse to run. He could turn and escape--she was down in the prison, the telaporter was out cold. She would get what she deserved, and he would be safe. Slowly he stood up, swaying slightly. He was still losing blood, and the electrical discharge had weakened him. He looked at her, then down the corridor, then back. Slowly he began to walk toward the cell, hauling Leo over his shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
He dropped downwards, staggering as he landed. He deposited the unconscious Leo on the cot then sank to the floor.<br/>
<br/>
"He'll be... all right... in a few hours." He panted, very glad that he could not feel the pain.<br/>
<br/>
"But he knows what's happened here, once he wakes up..."<br/>
<br/>
He glanced over at the cot, then stood up. "I can wipe a minimal amount of memory... It should be enough." He closed his eyes and pressed a spidery hand over Leo's chest. Energy crackled under his fingers, and he furrowed his brow in concentration.<br/>
Leo took a sudden breath, and John let go, opening his eyes. That should hAve done it. As long as he stays out, you should be safe." He leaned back, breathing deeply. His face had drained of almost all its color and his eyes had gone dull and glassy.<br/>
_______________________________________________________________________________<br/>
<br/>
Gen stared at Cynthia. "How do you <span style="font-style: italic;">know?</span>"<br/>
<br/>
"I just do!"<br/>
Gen's eyes narrowed, but she didn't comment.<br/>
"Max, can we make this thing go any faster?"<br/>
<br/>
"Not if we want to keep ourselves discreetly hidden from prying eyes- but if we don't care about that anymore, I-... Hang on."<br/>
<br/>
Gen watched in astonishment as he raced back through the plane, tore a pair of binoculars from the overhang compartment, and came dashing back.<br/>
From her corner, Shade stared at him with one raised eyebrow, a finally lit cigarette in her mouth--completely ignoring the fire hazard.<br/>
<br/>
"I found us a landing zone, but you're still going to have to trek a little ways to actually get to the site, judging from the last coordinates that we got before it went all fuzzy. I'll stay with the plane in case they have patrolling units and need to relocate, or things start to get hot and you need a quick get-away." He said, bringing them down with a bump, tractoring to a stop. "Are we anywhere near where we're supposed to be?"<br/>
<br/>
Gen and Cynthia stuck their heads out of the door. "That look like anything to you?" Gen hissed. A large building complex lay sprawled out, rising above the treeline.<br/>
<br/>
Gen looked at him sharply, then nodded. "If anything happens to you, like if y'know, you die, radio back, kay?"<br/>
<br/>
He raised his eyebrows and smirked. "Roger that."<br/>
She nodded at Cynthia. "Lets get going."<br/>
<br/>
Shade stood up, extinguishing her cigarette on the wall. "I'm coming with you. You could use a bit of brawn."<br/>
<br/>

Leo looked a bit angry as he sat up and swiveled his feet to the floor in a single fluid movement. He glanced at the glass on the table, Sabrina and back at John,<br/>
"You almost made me forget, but it is a good thing you didn't because…" but then he vanished!<br/>
He reappeared around the corner from the Master, entered the room softly, and bowed to the Master and said, "oh mighty and magic Master, I have been having a feeling that the rebels are coming, and I think it would be wise to go to the tall watch tower to investigate this"<br/>
"Yes" the Master replied,"but first I must go to my prisoner to see how he is doing."<br/>
"Oh no my master I feel that the rebels are much too near for that!"<br/>
"Very well, *in a reluctant tone* I will go to the watch tower first"<br/>
"Thank you Master, let us go" </p>

Max called after them as he stood up and made his way towards the door as well, pulling it shut after Shade hopped out. <span style="font-style: italic;">I'll just stay here, and... keep watch. Yeah... fun.</span> He started to think about something productive to do while he waited, making sure the radio was turned on.<br/>
<br/>
---<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Just you wait, Rebels. Karo's A-comin', and he h'aint got time for small talk.</span><br/>
<br/>
"Are you talking to yourself again? You know that grates on every nerve I own, right?"<br/>
Karo glanced up from his lovely collection and paused in his step for a moment, then pushed his way through the doorway and past the 5'3 blonde-haired, smug-faced nuisance. "You get this look on your face, kinda smirk-ish n' yer eyes get all lost-like... It creeps me out, man."<br/>
<br/>
"Well stop lookin' at me when I'm thinkin', and that'll solve all yer problems, Kate." He turned down the second, shorter hallway and prayed to whatever God there was for some duct-tape to shut the annoying man's gob up.<br/>
"It's Kasey, not Kate... and It'll turn this pathetic mop darker?" He ran his left hand, with an askew glance at the awkward pinky- a baseball accident with a very entertaining story behind it- through the loose hair, and drew a short honey-blond strand through the thumb, fore- and middle-fingers.<br/>
<br/>
"If you don' shuddup, I'll make it all disappear. How'd you like that?" Karo stopped at the door leading up into the living-room of his squat house long enough to open it and start up a couple of steps, listening for the familiar <span style="font-style: italic;">click</span> as the door locked shut behind them.<br/>
"'ow'd you manage to git down here, anyway?"<br/>
"It's a magic trick, but I can tell-"<br/>
"I don' want to hear it, jus' get yourself lost." He tromped up the heavily-worn stairs and stalked towards the kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
"Fine, but while you're going after whats-his-face, the tall lanky-one, remember that those Agents are still runnin' around." The thought suddenly struck him between his eyes. "But you already knew that, huh. Alright, well, nice seeing you again sunshine!" He turned towards the door but Karo stopped him. "How do <span style="font-style: italic;">you</span> know about them?"<br/>
Kasey grinned. "I have ears."<br/>
"But nuttin' 'tween 'em." Karo reminded as he gripped the lid off a warm Cola sitting on the dirty counter-top and sneezed as the dust unsettled.<br/>
"I'd love one, <span style="font-style: italic;">thanks!</span>" Kasey monotoned as he stretched across the counter, but Karo gripped his forearm, dragging him halfway onto the counter, away from the soda.<br/>
<br/>
"You know all them guns down there? I'd been thinking in the past couple of minutes how little target 'practice' I git."<br/>
Kasey wet his lips. "And I can tell what a dilemma that is for you-"<br/>
"You wouldn't happen to have anything that might... Change my mind, would you?"<br/>
"-And I would <span style="font-style: italic;">love</span> to tell you about the plane I heard roaring down- well, <span style="font-style: italic;">I</span> didn't hear it, those security guys on that radio you have set up over there heard it and they were on their way down to have a look at it when I walked in."<br/>
"Intrer'stin." Karo smirked as he lifted the bottle to his lips. </p>

        <p class="post"> "As long as he stays out, you should be safe." John leaned back, breathing deeply. His face had drained of almost all its color and his eyes had gone dull and glassy.<br/>
<br/>
He began sliding to the floor. Sabrina jumped forward and caught him just before he crashed down. With a great deal of trouble, she laid him on the floor. He was rather too long to fit, but she did the best she could. He seemed to have fainted…or worse. <br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic;">No! No, I can't have come to help him just for him to die!</span> She checked her pack, but no bandages were within. <span style="font-style: italic;">What? I forgot? Sabrina! What's happened to you lately?</span> She checked through all the little bottles and packets, but couldn't find the right one. <br/>
<br/>
Then she remembered. It was on the shelf in her personal room. She would have to get it.<br/>
<br/>
Then she looked at John. He didn't look quite dead, but he looked close. She would have to leave him to get the right medicine, but what if he died while she was absent? Or what if The Master came back and hauled him off to who-knows-where? Or what if he woke up while she was gone? He would surely think he was betrayed.<br/>
<br/>
Sabrina was so frustrated she wanted to yell. But she didn't. She just stamped on the floor a couple times, hard, and looked at John again. Then she pulled the bandage out of her pack and gently wrapped his arm. He didn't seem to feel anything, but he might. <br/>
<br/>
Then Sabrina knew what she must do. She pulled out her communicator and typed in, "Cynthia! John's dying and we need you! Patrols are on the alert. Use the back entrance. Reply soon!" She pulled out a bit of paper and scrawled, <span style="font-style: italic;">"I'll be back. S"</span> on it and laid it on John's knee next to a bottle of medicine. She put the other stuff back in her pack and bent toward John's ear. Just in case he was still awake, she whispered, "Don't worry, I'll return!" and hopped out of the cell. She lowered the door until it was a crack open. From the outside it looked shut, but on the inside there was an obvious gap. Then she raced down the hall and around a corner. </p>

I still want you--" he pulled him closer, until Kasey could smell his hot, acrid breath. " To git. Out. Of. My. Face."<br/>
<br/>
He released his hold on the man's arm, and Kasey fell back into one of the dusty bar chairs with a clatter. Karo smirked and took another swig of his drink. "So, where 'bouts did you happen to <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> this plane come down?"<br/>
<br/>
"You're really not catching on, are you?--er, about a mile and a half out in the woods. Near the big pond."<br/>
<br/>
"Great." he stood up and gripped Kasey's forearm firmly once more. "You're comin' with me, Kate."<br/>

        <p class="post"> A haze enveloped him. He couldn't see, couldn't hear or feel. All understanding of what was happening slipped away and vanished, replaced by the image of a tall, thin woman sitting on a bed, crying.<br/>
<br/>
He was standing outside her door, his small hands still a little chubby and not yet long and spidery. He watched her, too amazed by the fact that she was crying to go in, or reveal that he had been eavesdropping when he should have been in bed long before.<br/>
<br/>
He watched as the woman tore at her sawtooth hair, clawing at her angular, hollow face and avoiding the large mirror that faced the bed. A festive looking box lay open next to her, and her hands were stained with chocolate.<br/>
And she was still crying.<br/>
<br/>
Slowly, carefully, he pushed open the enormously tall door (his head barely reaching the handle), and walked into the room, his little bare feet making hardly a sound on the furred rug.<br/>
<br/>
He stopped by the side of the bed, staring timidly at the woman with his large, black eyes. She hadn't yet noticed him. His eyes slipped to the box of chocolates, then back to her angular, beautiful face.<br/>
<br/>
"Momma?" he whispered. "Its ok Momma, don't cry. I think you're beautiful."<br/>
<br/>
His mother turned to look at him her eyes, a startling green (although currently red and puffy), falling on his open, innocent face. Something like remorse came into her gaze and she reached out to him. He trotted into her embrace, blinking as he felt the hot, salty tears dripping onto his round cheeks.<br/>
<br/>
"John," she breathed, stroking his electrocuted, dark brown fuzz. "Some day, when you're older, you will understand why we gave you a human name."<br/>
<br/>
"Aronan's name isn't human!" he said crossly, looking up into her face, which had darkened.<br/>
<br/>
"Aronan isn't like you. He is too Zeranorian. Maybe you're little sister will turn out better." <br/>
<br/>
"But we're <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> Zeranorian!" He said, glancing back at the box. "I'm not a human."<br/>
<br/>
"No, you're not," she said quietly, picking up the chocolates, closing the lid, and sliding them under the bed. John could hear the shuffling and clattering as other empty boxes, disturbed by the intrusion, fell over or were pushed aside.<br/>
He looked up at his mother's face, and she smiled.<br/>
"You're right. You're not human," she placed a hand on his head and ruffled his hair. "Not yet. Go back to bed, you've got a big day tomorrow! I'll wake you up early and you can sleep in the ship, ok?"<br/>
<br/>
"Ok!" he said cheerfully, standing up on tiptoes. "Can I fly it?" His eyes danced happily.<br/>
<br/>
"Maybe some day. Now get some rest, you'll need it for tomorrow."<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Rest....</span><br/>

"How much further do we have to go?" Shade growled, swatting through a thorn bush.<br/>
<br/>
"If this tracker is correct--which it probably isn't, considering the interference--about a mile. Or maybe four." Gen frowned, turning the device upside down. Shade snarled and swatted away a fly.<br/>
<br/>
"This is ridiculous. I'm not walking all that way like this."<br/>
<br/>
"Well seeing as you don't have much choice--" Gen began angrily, but then broke off, staring in astonishment. Shade's body had twisted, bending into a four legged creature, and finally stabilizing in the form of an enormous wolf.<br/>
<br/>
"Feeling better?" Gen asked sarcastically, staring her up and down with wide eyes.<br/>
<br/>
"Much," the wolf snapped, raising her head and turning to the west. "I can smell them."<br/>
<br/>
"And thats not creepy at all..."<br/>
<br/>
"Two, heading our way. Steel, tungsten, gunpowder," her hackles began to rise. "They're armed." </p>

        <p class="post"> Sabrina slammed her room door and leaned against it, breathing hard. She didn't give herself time to think that she was explicitly disobeying The Master's orders--"Leave the prisoner to me." She stood on her bed and reached to the top shelf. This was one of the few problems with being short--she couldn't reach things. The plus side was that she could hide places where others couldn't. After flailing her arm around, she heard the wanted bottle tip over and roll to the back.<br/>
<br/>
Sabrina sighed and hopped up on the lowest shelf. Even now her eyes only just came over the edge. She reached an arm over and seized the bottle.<br/>
<br/>
Sticky liquid dripped onto her fingers through a conspicuous crack. The liquid was fast draining. If there was much more gone, there wouldn't be enough to save John. She didn't know if it would save him anyway. Only her extreme training kept her from crying out in rage, but she had learnt long ago that screaming never helped anyone--especially when you had a Master who liked things quiet. So she put the bottle in a leakproof bag and zipped out of the room.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody was around when she reached the cell, so she had no qualms about hopping in again. The medicine bottle and note were where she had left them. There seemed to be enough liquid remaining in the bottle, but you could never tell. There was only one problem: The dying person had to be awake. And unless she was mistaken, John was far from awake.<br/>
<br/>
Sabrina leaned close to his ear. "John! John, wake up! I've got the medicine!…John, I...JOHN!"<br/>
<br/>
She gently shook him, careful not to touch his injured arm. There was no response. She called again. She wished for the thousandth time that she had powers like Cynthia, not just physical skills. She bit her lip and tried to rouse him again.<br/>
<br/>
"Wake up, you Rebel…you stealer of my instructions…wake up, you Zeranorian…please…don't die…don't do this to me…"<br/>
<br/>
She checked her communicator. Cynthia had not replied.<br/>
<br/>
Sabrina's voice began to tremble. "By all the powers on the planet, I command you to WAKE UP!--please--I don't care what The Master thinks--just--for only five seconds!--please--" <br/>
<br/>
For the first time in ten years, Sabrina was crying. </p>

        <p class="post"> The tears were still on his hollow cheeks, falling salty and warm on his face and neck. He raised a shaking hand to brush them away, and a voice spoke through the silence, quietly at first, then getting louder and louder. He pulled his eyes ope a crack.<br/>
<br/>
"By all the powers on the planet, I command you to WAKE UP!--please--I don't care what The Master thinks--just--for only five seconds!--please--"<br/>
<br/>
Tears.<br/>
<br/>
"Don't cry," he whispered, "please don't cry."<br/>
<br/>
Her fingers were stained a sticky brown, the tear streaks on her face and the regret and fear in her eyes remarkably familiar. She saw his eyes open and grabbed for the bottle, pouring its contents down his throat. His eyes widened and he coughed, sputtering indignantly.<br/>
"Give... a man some warning... Before you try to drown him!" He tried to sit up, bending his head and breathing deeply. Already some color was coming back into his face. He pushed his glasses up his nose and looked questioningly up at Sabrina, who has stopped crying.<br/>
<br/>
He couldn't figure her out; one moment she was praising the Master and following his commands to the point of mortal peril, next she was going directly against his orders and helping <span style="font-style: italic;">him</span>, of all people. He shook his head gently, closing his eyes, but when he opened them, everything was exactly the same. She was saving him.<br/>
He opened his eyes again and looked at her, albeit dazedly.<br/>
<br/>
"What changed your mind?" he whispered. She shook her head, looking almost as dazed as he was. <br/>
<br/>
(Bah, this isn't that good, but it'll do for now. I'll make it prettier when we get out of this snowstorm <img alt="wink" class="smilie smilie_45" src="https://amblesideonline.org/forum/images/smilies/winkie.gif" title="wink"/>) </p>

<br/>
"Cynthia! John's dying and we need you! Patrols are on the alert. Use the back entrance. Reply soon!" <br/>
<br/>
Cynthia received the message and went pale, she KNEW she needed to go, she couldn't stay behind Gen and Shade, a guard was coming and would recognize her. <br/>
<br/>
She slowly slipped away and ran to the gate surrounding the Master's headquarters, quickly climbed it and went to the back door, she scanned her I.D. card walked in. Once inside she listened carefully, all was silent, "Wait! Was that crying?" She listened again, trying to figure out where it was coming from. "It was Sabrina!" She recognized the sound of crying from the awful time in their lives when Cynthia and Sabrina's parents had died in a riot of the rebels. <br/>
<br/>
She briskly, but quietly ran to the sounds and when she arrived she saw Sabrina and John smiling at each other. <br/>
<br/>
"Sorry to burst in at this beautiful moment guys, but does someone need healing?" <br/>
<br/>
"Cynthia!" Sabrina cried, "Where were you? Why didn't you respond? I thought...if I didn't get the medicine in time..." She didn't finish, but said, "John's still hurt, can you heal him?" <br/>
John tried to sit up, unsuccessfully, "My arm." He said, slumping back down, lightheaded. <br/>
Cynthia rushed over and held his arm in her warm, healing hands, "Hold still." She commanded, "This will only take a minute." <br/>
<br/>
And in 10 minutes John, despite feeling a tad faint still, was good. <br/>
"Now to get you out of here..." Sabrina said, sounding nervous and looking at Cynthia. </p>

        <p class="post"> "Yes. He needs to get out of here," Cynthia replied firmly.<br/>
<br/>
Sabrina looked relieved. "Whatever happens, we can't let The Master find out!" she said. "So, are your Rebel friends still blundering about in the woods?"<br/>
<br/>
"I think," said Cynthia.<br/>
<br/>
"Well, they're in for a surprise," said Sabrina shortly. She looked at John. "Now, how to get you out of this mess in one piece. Cynthia, if you take him out of the back entrance into the fields till the shooting's done, I think that'll be good. Meanwhile I'll go and…How does that sound?"<br/>
<br/>
John looked surprised. "Shooting?"<br/>
<br/>
Sabrina dropped her head. "Well," she said slowly, "I…oh, never mind. I couldn't explain it to you." She raised her eyes again to his face. "As long as you get out of here, nothing else matters." She blushed hotly and hopped out of the cell. "I've got work to do." </p>

        <p class="post"> "C'mon John." Cynthia said, trying to help him up. <br/>
John slowly got up, a little lightheaded still so Cynthia tried to held him stand straight, despite the fact he was almost a head and a half taller than her. They were about to reach the door when they heard footsteps. "Who's that?" John whispered, "The Master!" Cynthia gasped. "We've got to get out of here, now! Do you best to run to the door, I'll stall him." </p>

        <p class="post"> John's eyes widened. "Shooting?!"<br/>

"I…oh, never mind. I couldn't explain it to you." She raised her eyes again to his face. "As long as you get out of here, nothing else matters." She hopped out of the cell. "I've got work to do."<br/>
<br/>
She blushed, and he stared at her, feeling dazed again. Shooting? Who was being shot? A horror or images flashed across his mind of all his friends and rescuers being shot to pieces. He gritted his teeth and shook his head.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly the sound of footsteps filled the chamber, and they all three of the. Stopped, Sabrina by the door, John and Cynthia by the cell.<br/>
<br/>
"It's the master!" Cynthia hissed, staring with wide eyes at the door. She turned to John, pushing him towards the other side of the room where another exit lay.<br/>
<br/>
"We've got to get out of here, now! Do you best to run to the door, I'll stall him."<br/>
<br/>
But he dug his heels into the ground, leaning back. "There's no way I'm leaving you two behind!" He whispered back. "You saved my life, time for me to return the favor."<br/>
<br/>
And he whirled around, punching her in the nose. Sabrina turned on him, disbelief in her eyes as he lunged for her too. His hand touched her arm, and she felt a wave of--something like electricity, but gentler--course through her skin.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic;">No time to explain. Trust me.</span> Then he grabbed her by the collar and lifted her against the wall.<br/>
<br/>
The door slid open with a hiss.<br/>
<br/>
The Master was framed in the doorway, staring at them with emotionless eyes.<br/>
John's eyes flicked towards him two seconds before he was forced back. The Master's kinetic field held him motionless, hanging in the middle of the room.<br/>
<br/>
"Well well. Maybe not so weak after all. You healed quickly."<br/>
<br/>
"There's a lot you don't know, especially about our species. Including the fact that our telepathic abilities are unparalleled." He glanced down at Cynthia and Sabrina. "It was child's play to control such weak human beasts, even from within the cell."<br/>
